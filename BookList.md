### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
###### Patrick Lencioni

### Turn the Ship Around
###### David Marquet

Turn the Ship Around! is the story of how David Marquet took the U.S. Santa Fe nuclear submarine from worst to first by challenging the U.S. Navy’s traditional leader-follower approach and implementing his own framework of leader-leader. The results revolutionised the field of leadership, as each member of Marquet’s crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions.

By embedding goodness in the practices and people, Santa Fe continued to win awards and promoted a highly disproportionate number of officers to submarine
command. Stephen R. Covey visited the Santa Fe and called it the most empowering organization he’d ever seen.

### What Got You Here Won’t Get You There
_Marshall Goldsmith_
Marshall Goldsmith begins by examining the trouble with success, explaining how previous accomplishments often prevent leaders from gaining more success. He analyses why high achievers are so resistant to change due to their delusion of success, pointing out that they can’t see that what got them here won’t get them there.

Goldsmith details the 20 habits that hold you back from the top rung of the corporate ladder. In his experience, these are the most irritating interpersonal issues in the workplace. For each habit, he gives examples and practical solutions you can implement. He then describes the 21st habit, which stands separate from the other 20 habits –– not because it is a flaw, but because it is often the root of an annoying behaviour.
Finally, Goldsmith addresses the problem of how you can change your interpersonal relationships for the better, and ensure that you make your behavioral changes permanent.

### Blink
_Malcolm Gladwell_
Blink is all about those moments when we ‘know’ something without really knowing why, and how this ability is one of the most powerful we possess.
