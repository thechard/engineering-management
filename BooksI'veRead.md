###### Stephen R. Covey 
#### Why I'm reading this
This book was recommended to me by one of my direct reports. I'm starting to think about where I want to head next in my career and looking for tools that can help me with that next step. This is a popular book that I heard about in some of the leadership training courses I went on when I first became a people lead. When my direct report talked about how great this book was recently I decided I should finally give it a go and see what I could learn from it.

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
###### Patrick Lencioni

#### Why I read this
This book was recommended to me by my direct manager when I first became a people lead. When I first became a people lead I was the direct manager of 4 engineers and 1 qualtiy assurance engineer, all working in the same team as myself. My team wasn't very functional when I first joined. I could go on for a while about all the problems I saw, but here's a few of the biggest issues I first noticed: people worked on anything they liked regardless of if it helped towards the teams long term goals, they didn't collaborate with each other, people were being left out/behind and they couldn't easily explain why the options they chose were the best choice. 

This book is a really interesting story that get's into how to build a great team and some of the warning signs to look out for in your team. This book helped me to see the forrest for the tree's and prioritise which problems in my team to tackle first.

#### Summary From Amazon

Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.

Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.

### Turn the Ship Around
###### David Marquet

#### Why I read this
This was another book that was recommended to me by my direct manager when I first became a people lead. Entering a new team that needed a lot of improvement was a new challenge for me. This book really helped me find my leadership style and gave me ideas for how to empower my team to think and improve things for themselves - rather than dictating changes to them. I also liked that it reminded me to be kind to myself. Mistakes are enevitable, especially when starting out on a leadership journey, it's important to admit your mistakes and grow from them rather than dwelling on them or letting them defeat you.

#### Summary From Amazon
Turn the Ship Around! is the story of how David Marquet took the U.S. Santa Fe nuclear submarine from worst to first by challenging the U.S. Navy’s traditional leader-follower approach and implementing his own framework of leader-leader. The results revolutionised the field of leadership, as each member of Marquet’s crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions.

By embedding goodness in the practices and people, Santa Fe continued to win awards and promoted a highly disproportionate number of officers to submarine
command. Stephen R. Covey visited the Santa Fe and called it the most empowering organization he’d ever seen.

### Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations
###### Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble and Gene Kim
#### Why I read this
This book was a recommendation from a wide range of people. It became a pretty hot topic at my work and everyone was buzzing about it. I read it so I could find out what everyone was talking about. It's not the easiest read, and I'd recommend only reading the first two parts of the book - the last section tries to tell a fictional story using the information previously described but isn't all that useful or interesting.
If you're in the tech industry and want your teams to be productive and delivering high quality work in a timely fashion, this is the book that lays out all the key qualities you need to foster in your team and company. A lot of it seemed obvious to me as I'm from a developer background but this book is able to provide research and give clear logical reasoning behind why having these practices in place lead to better performance. This book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve the delivery of their technical teams, and especially anyone that needs to sell and get buy in for these ideas/practices at their company.

#### Summary From Amazon
How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we've been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn't matter―that it can't provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through four years of groundbreaking research to include data collected from the State of DevOps reports conducted with Puppet, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the science behind that research, making the information accessible for readers to apply in their own organizations.
Readers will discover how to measure the performance of their teams, and what capabilities they should invest in to drive higher performance. This book is ideal for management at every level.


### Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High, Second Edition
###### Kerry Patterson
#### Why I read this
Around the time I decided to read this I was struggling with a collegue, we were often butting heads and I felt he wasn't being receptive to feedback.
Crucial Conversations gives great advice on how to handle difficult conversations with people. This book is not only useful for managers but for every day life. It gave me tips on how to identify why someone might be reacting badly to a conversation and how to bring the conversation to a healther place so we could both move forward. I can't stress enough how useful this book was, it helped me realise how I wasn't be clear with my intentions and gave me tools for resolving challenging situations.

#### Summary From Amazon
The first edition of Crucial Conversations exploded onto the scene and revolutionized the way millions of people communicate when stakes are high. This new edition gives you the tools to:

    Prepare for high-stakes situations
    Transform anger and hurt feelings into powerful dialogue
    Make it safe to talk about almost anything
    Be persuasive, not abrasive


### The Coaching Habit
###### Michael Bungay Stanier
#### Why I read this
Coaching is a fundamental skill for becoming a great people lead. I understood the high level concepts of coaching before I picked up this book, but I wasn't great at putting coaching skills into practicewhen it really mattered.
The Coaching Habit has great advice on how to coach rather than tell someone what to do. It has good ideas of how to ask open ended/non-judgemental questions to help people realise for themselves what they should do next. It also has good tips and tricks on how to change your behaviour and form new habbits. I changed how I conducted one to one catch ups with my people because of what I learnt in this book,  and now I try to use the questions outlined in this book whenever I can.

#### Summary From Amazon
In Michael Bungay Stanier's The Coaching Habit, coaching becomes a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less hard and have more impact.
Drawing on years of experience training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples' potential. He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how--by saying less and asking more--you can develop coaching methods that produce great results.

### Good Boss Bad Boss
######  Robert Sutton
#### Why I read this
This book was recommended by my company's CEO. Our CEO challenged all the people leads to continue to grow and develop their management skills and he mentioned that this was the book he was reading at that time, and challenged us to have read it by the time we next caught up.

I didn't go into this book with any expectations and didn't really know what to expect. Good Boss Bad Boss is an interesting collection of tales building up to a collection of behaviours/attributes that the best bosses have, based on the authors research and experiences. It helped highlight some common pitfalls of people management, and gave insights into the qualities some of the best people leads have. It helped me prioritise which qualities I needed to improve on next as a people lead.

#### Summary From Amazon

If you are a boss who wants to do great work, what can you do about it? Good Boss, Bad Boss is devoted to answering that question. Stanford Professor Robert Sutton weaves together the best psychological and management research with compelling stories and cases to reveal the mindset and moves of the best (and worst) bosses. This book was inspired by the deluge of emails, research, phone calls, and conversations that Dr. Sutton experienced after publishing his blockbuster bestseller The No Asshole Rule.

### Dare to Lead
###### Brene Brown
#### Why I read this
This book was recommended by a few people, it was also rumoured it was the next book recommendation of our CEO. I didn't know know much about this book going into it so didn't really know what to expect, now that I've finished it I can't recommend it enough. This book is for anyone thinking about a leadership role, not just for managers. It covers a range of topics and all of them come down to how to be a great leader. Some of it's lessons are; How to know yourself and live into your values, to lean into the paradoxes that come with leadership and to "embrace the suck". Read. This. Book.

#### Summary From Amazon
Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.

When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.

But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection and courage to start.

Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:
