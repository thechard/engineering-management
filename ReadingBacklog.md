###### Doc Norton

#### Why I want to read this
I'm interested in finding better metrics to help predict/estimate when work will be completed by. As my team has moved to Kanban velocity is more complicated to measure, yet we still need to set expectations with our stakeholders around when work will likely be completed by.
#### Summary From Amazon
Time and time again, I find teams struggling with Velocity as a genuinely helpful metric. In most cases, it is at best a weak tool for planning work and more often a poor tool for indicating what work will be done by when. In "Escape Velocity" we consider better alternatives to Velocity as a metric.
