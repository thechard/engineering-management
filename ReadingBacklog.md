### Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us
###### by Daniel H. Pink
#### Why I want to read this
Something I've always struggled with as a people lead is figuring out peoples underlying motivators. Understanding peoples motivations is a key skill as a leader and getting them wrong can be quite eye opening. This book is all about what motivates people so I'm hoping it can help me to improve these skills to help me become a better leader.
#### Summary From Amazon
Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people - at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink explains in his new and paradigm-shattering book DRIVE: THE SURPRISING TRUTH ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATES US, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does - and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In DRIVE, he reveals the three elements of true motivation: AUTONOMY - the desire to direct our own lives; MASTERY - the urge to get better and better at something that matters; PURPOSE - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward. DRIVE is bursting with big ideas - the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.

###### by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford

### The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement
###### by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, Jeff Cox
#### Why I want to read this
As I mentioned above I love improving efficiency and delivery. I'm also interested in how to best help my direct reports continue to grow in their careers. I found this book in a few recommendation lists when googling books on these topics.
#### Summary From Amazon
Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal, a gripping novel, is transforming management thinking throughout the world. It is a book to recommend to your friends in industry - even to your bosses - but not to your competitors. Alex Rogo is a harried plant manager working ever more desperately to try improve performance. His factory is rapidly heading for disaster. So is his marriage. He has ninety days to save his plant - or it will be closed by corporate HQ, with hundreds of job losses. It takes a chance meeting with a professor from student days - Jonah - to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done. The story of Alex's fight to save his plant is more than compulsive reading. It contains a serious message for all managers in industry and explains the ideas, which underline the Theory of Constraints (TOC), developed by Eli Goldratt.


One of Eli Goldratt’s convictions was that the goal of an individual or an organization should not be defined in absolute terms. A good definition of a goal is one that sets us on a path of ongoing improvement.
Pursuing such a goal necessitates more than one breakthrough. In fact it requires many. To be in a position to identify these breakthroughs we should have a deep understanding of the underlying rules of our environment. Twenty-five years after writing The Goal, Dr. Goldratt wrote Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. In this article he provided the underlying rules of operations. This article appears at the end of this book.


### Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't
###### by Simon Sinek
#### Why I want to read this
The book "Dare to Lead" by Brene Brown talks about trust being a pivitol part of any successful company, I did some research on management books on the topic of building trust and this is one that popped up a few times.
#### Summary From Amazon
Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled. This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful organizations, great leaders create environments in which people naturally work together to do remarkable things.

In his work with organizations around the world, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives are offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why?

The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general. "Officers eat last," he said. Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders sacrifice their own comfort--even their own survival--for the good of those in their care.
    
Too many workplaces are driven by cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest. But the best ones foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a "Circle of Safety" that separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside.

Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories that range from the military to big business, from government to investment banking.

### The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You
###### by Julie Zhuo
#### Why I want to read this
I've been doing some research on great books to read to grow people management skills, this is one that came up a few times in recommendation lists. I'm trying to grow the leadership skills of a few of my reports and am curious to see if this would be a good book to recommend to someone new to people leadership. Reading the summary I was also taken by the snippet "When you should look past an awkward interview and hire someone anyway" as my company is trying to improve it's hiring processes at the moment.
#### Summary From Amazon
That's exactly how Julie Zhuo felt when she became a rookie manager at the age of 25. She stared at a long list of logistics--from hiring to firing, from meeting to messaging, from planning to pitching--and faced a thousand questions and uncertainties. How was she supposed to spin teamwork into value? How could she be a good steward of her reports' careers? What was the secret to leading with confidence in new and unexpected situations?

Now, having managed dozens of teams spanning tens to hundreds of people, Julie knows the most important lesson of all: great managers are made, not born. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.

The Making of a Manager is a modern field guide packed everyday examples and transformative insights, including:

  *  How to tell a great manager from an average manager (illustrations included)
  *  When you should look past an awkward interview and hire someone anyway
  *  How to build trust with your reports through not being a boss
  *  Where to look when you lose faith and lack the answers

Whether you're new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted, this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you wish you had.

### First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently
###### Marcus Buckingham, Curt Coffman, Jim Harter
#### Why I want to read this
This book came up in several recommendation lists for how to be a great leader. The summary made it sound like an interesting book that has the potential to help me continue to grow my leadership skills.

#### Summary From Amazon
They actually have vastly different styles and backgrounds. Yet despite their differences, great managers share one common trait: They don't hesitate to break virtually every rule held sacred by conventional wisdom. They don't believe that, with enough training, a person can achieve anything he sets his mind to. They don't try to help people overcome their weaknesses. And, yes, they even play favorites.

In this longtime management bestseller, Gallup presents the remarkable findings of its massive in-depth study of great managers. Some were in leadership positions. Others were front-line supervisors. Some were in Fortune 500 companies; others were key players in small, entrepreneurial firms. Whatever their circumstances, the managers who ultimately became the focus of Gallup's research were those who excelled at turning each individual employee's talent into high performance.

Gallup has found that the front-line manager is the key to attracting and retaining talented employees. This book explains how the best managers select an employee for talent rather than for skills or experience, set expectations, build on each person's unique strengths rather than trying to fix his or her weaknesses, and get the best performance out of their teams.

And perhaps most important, Gallup's research produced the 12 simple statements that distinguish the strongest departments of a company from all the rest. First, Break All the Rules is the first book to present this essential measuring stick and to prove the link between employee opinions and productivity, profit, customer satisfaction and the rate of turnover.

First, Break All the Rules presents vital performance and career lessons for managers at every level - and best of all, shows you how to apply them to your own situation.

### Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs
###### by John Doerr, Larry Page
#### Why I want to read this
The next step in my career requires skills to prioritise conflicting priorities and make tough choices. This book sounds like it can help further develop insight into those skills.
#### Summary From Amazon
In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-up whom he'd just given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.

### The upside of stress
###### by Kelly McGonigal 
#### Why I want to read this
This book was recommended a few times by some of my collegues.
#### Summary From Amazon
You hear it all the time: stress causes heart disease; stress causes insomnia; stress is bad for you! But what if changing how you think about stress could make you happier, healthier, and better able to reach your goals? Combining exciting new research on resilience and mindset, Kelly McGonigal, PhD, proves that undergoing stress is not bad for you; it is undergoing stress while believing that stress is bad for you that makes it harmful. In fact, stress has many benefits, from giving us greater focus and energy, to strengthening our personal relationships.
 
McGonigal shows readers how to cultivate a mindset that embraces stress, and activate the brain's natural ability to learn from challenging experiences. Both practical and life-changing, The Upside of Stress is not a guide to getting rid of stress, but a toolkit for getting better at it—by understanding, accepting, and leveraging it to your advantage.

### Escape Velocity
###### Doc Norton
https://leanpub.com/escapevelocity?__s=3rgyrnijvgbeksw7vz4d
#### Why I want to read this
I'm interested in finding better metrics to help predict/estimate when work will be completed by. As my team has moved to Kanban velocity is more complicated to measure, yet we still need to set expectations with our stakeholders around when work will likely be completed by.
#### Summary From Amazon
Time and time again, I find teams struggling with Velocity as a genuinely helpful metric. In most cases, it is at best a weak tool for planning work and more often a poor tool for indicating what work will be done by when. In "Escape Velocity" we consider better alternatives to Velocity as a metric.
